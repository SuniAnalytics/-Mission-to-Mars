# Mission-to-Mars

# Objective
 
   Purpose of the project is to perform a web scarping and data analysis for Mission to Mars project. Goal is to utilize skills like Automated browsing with splinter, HTML parsing to scrape, analyse and provide insights of the data.
   
   This has two parts as part of the project
    - Web Scrape: Scrape a webpage for mars related new articles
    - Data Analysis: Scrape, analyze and provide insights on Mars weather data

5.       
About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
